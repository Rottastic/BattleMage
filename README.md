# BattleMage
Small artillery-style game concept. Result of following along with Ben Tristam's Unreal Course on Udemy.

Face off against AI opponents as a powerful mage. Aim spells carefully while darting around, avoiding incoming attacks. Tactical movement, utilizing the highs and lows of the terrain, is key in besting your opponent. You play from an over the shoulder (3rd Person) perspective and the UI assists in aiming your attacks by showing you trajectories and landing zones.
# Assets Required
Several things I need to round up for the prototype. I'll be looking for free-to-use assets to fill the majority, but if necessary I will hand-craft the remainder.

## Visuals
* Cloth "Robe" for Mages
* Cloth Textures
* Particles for Attack
* Particles for Movement
* Environment Textures

## Audio
* Movement feedback (wind, etc)
* Attack Charging & Launch
* Death feedback
